# Text To Speech RoboSpeaker

This project is a simple Python-based text-to-speech (TTS) application called **RoboSpeaker**. It allows users to input text, which will be read out loud using the `pyttsx3` library. The program continues to process input until the user types "STOP", at which point it will thank the user and exit.

## Features

- Converts any text input into speech.
- Allows continuous text-to-speech conversion until "STOP" is typed.
- Uses the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech functionality.
- Simple and interactive command-line interface.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need to install the **`pyttsx3`** library. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
